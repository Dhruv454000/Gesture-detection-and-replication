## About the Project
To detect and recognise basic hand gestures and imitate them using a simulation of a robotic hand. Recognition of gestures can be done using various approaches like CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), feature engineering (such as binary thresholding, circle detection, etc.), and others. The simulation will be done using CoppeliaSim.In this project will be focusing on two methods. 1.CNN's(for more information see in project resources link below) 2.opencv(contours detection).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Follow below steps
* Install coppeliasim:   [https://coppeliarobotics.com/downloads](https://coppeliarobotics.com/downloads)

* Any code editor

* Python  [Python 3.6 and above](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
* The installations provided below are installed using pip. so you first need to install pip.

     [Install pip following this steps](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/)
* To install numpy
 ```sh
    pip install numpy
  ```
* To install OpenCV
  ```sh
   pip install opencv-python
  ```
* To install keras(required if you are using cnn approach)

  [steps to install keras](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/keras/keras_installation.htm)
  
* If you want you can install matplotlib,cvzone and other libraries.
### Installation
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dhruv454000/Gesture-detection-and-replication
```
## Usage

(steps to run project)

After cloning the repo transfer the files to your project folder. Open terminal and go to the project folder and run the following commands:-

1.First open coppeliasim and then open the scene in coppeliasim.

2.Now run **_python filename.py_** in cmd (make sure you are in same directory where your filename.py is saved)

## Theory and Approach

Our main idea of this project is to detect hand gestures like one, two,thumbs up,
okâ€¦.etc using open cv (convex defect algorithm) and run corresponding simulations on
coppeliasim using a model which will replicate this simulations.Initially we had decided 
to use CNN model for gesture detection but due to less accuracy of model we decided to use
approach which is based on contours detection and convexity defects for gesture detection.
We connect with coppeliasim with help of python api functions provided by coppeliasim.
For  above things you will need to have basic knowledge python and opencv.Also basic
coppeliasim knowlegde is required. some links for coppeliasim has been provided below in
resources .For CNN approach you can use the links provided below in the resources
folder to learn theory and some courses are also provided below.
For the contours approach you can follow the algorithm shown below:

## Results and Demo

So as you can see in the image when **_vertical fist_** was detected then the arm that you see in right side window is oriented at some position.
similarly you can move the arm by detecting different gestures.

## Future work         
* We would like to add more gestures and while replicating it on coppeliasim we can keep some particular target and try to reach that with help of gesture detection. Also we can add some text in coppeliasim to describe which gesture was detected at that movement.

* We could make a gesture controlled game. Not yet thought but could try in future.
